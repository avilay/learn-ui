        <h1>Bootstrap Utilities</h1>
        <p>
          This page demonstrates some of the harder to grok utilities in bootstrap. There are many more that are easy to
          understand from the documentation that are not demonstrated here. Check out the full list in
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/api/">Bootstrap's Utilities documentation</a>.

      <section>
        <div class="clearfix">
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/100x30?text=Responsive floated image"
            class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="image">

          <h3>Floating Divs</h3>
          <p>
            This demos the .float-end class. It causes the image to "float" to the right. I have used .float-md-end
            instead of .float-end so that I can see how it would look if float-end was not given by narrowing the
            screen size to less than -md. For some reason whenever I am messing around with the floats I need to set
            the .clearfix style in the parent. There is some discussion on
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8554043/what-is-a-clearfix">Stackoverflow on this</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with
            some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually
            conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
          </p>

          <p>
            And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or
            some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.

        <h3>Spacing</h3>
        <p>
          This demos how to set custom margin and padding on any element. I am using the background color here to show
          this more clearly. Checkout the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/">Bootstrap
            Spacing documentation</a>
          for the shorthand.
