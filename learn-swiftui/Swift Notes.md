# Swift Notes

### Console App

Here is how to create a console app -

<img src="./create_console_app.png" alt="screenshot" style="zoom:25%;" />

The binary is created in some sort of a temp dir which I can get like so -

<img src="./build_folder.png" alt="build_folder" style="zoom:25%;" />

As part of the build process, I can tell xcode to copy the built file to some directory of my choice in the build settings. See the full video of me creating and running a console app in [create_console_app.mp4](./create_console_app.mp4). 

### Adding 3rd Party Packages

When in a project go to `File > Add Packages ...` in the window either search for the package name or add the package URL directly.
